/**
 * Base domain model it can be DTO or nested Model. it is the important message
 * between business layer and view layer. in view layer, it is created by form
 * object(such as ActionForm object)ï¼›in business layer, it is created by
 * business components(such as session bean).
 * 
 * thi class can be cached, and setModified is important, this method can be
 * used to refresh the cache.
 * 
 * because setModified function ,so the class is designed for a class, but not a
 * interface.
 * 
 * the difference with setModified and setCacheable; setCacheable to false, the
 * model will never exist in the cache. setModified to true, if the model exists
 * in the cache, the client will not get it from cache, it is same as being
 * deleted from cache . deleting the model from cache must have a condition that
 * the deleting operator can access the cache of the container, if it cann't
 * access the container, it cann't delete the model from cache. such it is EJB.
